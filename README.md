# Mobile Flashcards Project

This project represents the third and final course project for Udacity's React Nanodegree course.

## Setup

To setup the project to run:

* Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* Start the development server with `npm start`
* After running `npm start`, you will get the Expo IDE.  From there, you will be able to run the simulators you need to run to test in iOS and/or Android. 

## Note

This project has been tested primarily with the iOS emulator.  The Android one has been throwing errors every now and again about font issues and I cannot figure out where the issue is stemming from.  It was working just fine without issue when I first started the project, but since the font issue, I haven't been able to reliably test it.
